# <p align="center">Introduction</p>
Some reorganizations of Level-X's GPX Shiny Tracker. These trackers include specific-type trackers and a past-SWSH tracker for anyone to enjoy!

This project is meant for a smaller, more particular portion of hunters with distinct preferences.
If you are searching for a specific type-tracker, for example, if you wanna own all Bug-type Pokemon in GPX, then the Bug-Type Tracker is just for you!
Or, if you want to see which Pokemon have been hunted already in a previous SWSH and want to get all the shinies from those lines, then the SWSH-Tracker is just for you.

The type-tracker uses Level-X's GPX Shiny Tracker "Standard Edition", while the SWSH-Tracker uses Level-X's GPX Shiny Tracker "Ultimate Edition". As such,
# <p align="center">It is important that you download Level-X's GPX Shiny Tracker</p>
<p align="center">which <a href="https://github.com/Level-X/GPX-Shiny-Tracker">can be found here</a>.</p>

If you have any question or suggestion, you can always <a href="https://gpx.plus/user/Rookie+Roo">contact me via GPX</a>, or preferably, by sending me a message or pinging me on Discord (rookie_roo). Without further ado, let me explain how you should have your directories in order for everything to work.

# <p align="center">Instructions</p>
<b>1. Download <a href="https://github.com/Level-X/GPX-Shiny-Tracker">Level-X's GPX Shiny Tracker zip</a>.</b>

<b>2. Unzip the contents of said repository.</b>
This leaves you with a directory ("GPX-Shiny Tracker-main"), and inside of it you have another directory ("Images"), 4 html files ("Getting Started", "GPX+ Shiny Tracker Standard", "GPX+ Shiny Tracker Minimalist", "GPX+ Shiny Tracker Ultimate"), 1 java script file ("Script-ClickProgress"), 1 css file ("style") and a README ("README.md").

<b>3. Download this repository and unzip the contents.</b>
You should have a directory that houses 1 html ("GPX+ Shiny Tracker SWSH"), two more directories ("Images2" and "Type Trackers") and a README ("README.md")

<b>4. Move the html, the two directories and the README2 inside the original "GPX-Shiny Tracker-main" folder.</b>
Now, this folder should have 3 directories, 5 html files, 1 java script file, 1 css file and two README in total. <b>NOTE:</b> Since both README have the same name, your system should ask you to overwrite, delete or rename the second README. I'd recommend renaming it to "README2" but you are free to do whatever you want!

<b>5. Enjoy!</b>
To use the SWSH Tracker, just double click on the GPX+ Shiny Tracker SWSH file and continue using it as you would with any other tracker from Level-X. If you want a specific type-tracker, just open the folder that houses them ("Type Trackers"), select the type you want and double click on it to open it.

These trackers grab the exact same java script, the css, and the mini-sprites that the original Shiny Trackers used, so everything should work just fine.

# <p align="center">Disclaimer</p>
The original html files are property of Level-X. It's thanks to him that I could even begin to "create" these trackers.
These trackers are, basically, glorified reorganized trackers. So if you want to thank someone, be sure to send X some nice words!
Likewise, these trackers use CycloneBlaze's javascript. It IS the same that X uses for the other trackers, and so I didn't modify anything from that file. Regardless, it's always important to thank the work that comes from other people because without that, maybe this trackers wouldn't have been made in the first place!

 # <p align="center">Final Words (asking for a little bit of help)</p>
 Currently, I do not have as much time as I used to do in the past. And, to top it off, I maybe I'm biting off more than I can chew, what with the SWSH's Pre-polls, the suggestions for site improvement, event ideas, Networking Ninjas, etc.
Due to that, I'm not ENTIRELY sure that I can keep up with the amount of work I'm adding to myself, so I kindly ask for <b>YOUR</b> help with these trackers.
It's simple! I just ask that, if you are interested in one of these trackers and you find that they haven't been updated, <b>PLEASE send me a message</b> and keep asking me to update it so I can make some time to do so! Seriously, it won't bother me at all, so feel free to ping me anytime!
I will try to at least keep the SWSH-tracker up-to-date, as that is the one I think would have the most use out of the these additions. Regardless, if I do NOT update it, PLEASE let me know. Likewise, if you are interested in another particular tracker, feel free to let me know and I will do my best to try and make it :D (For example, I can already see someone asking for a SWSH-Tracker but without gender differences... But until someone asks for it I shall keep it as it is... >:D)

Another thing for the type trackers is that I can't 100% say that I kept all the right Pokemon where they are. By that I mean that I am not 100% sure that ALL the Pokemon of that type are REALLY in that tracker, or that I didn't delete one Pokemon that DOESN'T have said type. Because of that, PLEASE, if you see any mistake let me know so I can fix it! If it helps, I'm at least 80% sure that the trackers have everything they say they have but, hey, I am also a human and could be wrong.

Lastly, if you DO end up using one of these trackers, PLEASE let me know! It's always sweet whenever I hear from you guys, and honestly, it motivates me into keeping all of these updated. Especially because it makes me feel like the time I spend on reorganizing HAS been useful, at least to someone, and that feels nice :D.
So, please:
